<dt>Football</dt>	
<dd>
Football refers to a variety of team sports that involve kicking a ball to score goals, with the rules and style of play varying depending on the specific type of football being played. The most common types include:</dd>
<dt>Rugby</dt>
<dd>
Rugby is a contact sport played between two teams, typically with 15 players each (in rugby union) or 13 players (in rugby league), although there are also variations with fewer players (such as rugby sevens, played with 7 players per side). The game is characterized by running with the ball, passing it, and kicking it to score points, while opposing players try to stop the ball carrier and regain possession.</dd>
<dt>Basketball</dt>
<dd>
Basketball is a fast-paced team sport played between two teams, typically of five players each, with the objective of scoring points by shooting a ball through the opposing teamâ€™s hoop or basket. The game is played on a rectangular court, and the team with the most points at the end of the game wins.</dd>
<dt>Volleyball</dt>
<dd>
Volleyball is a fast-paced team sport played between two teams, usually consisting of six players each, with the goal of scoring points by sending a ball over a net into the opponent's court. The ball is played by hitting it with the hands or arms, and the team that successfully lands the ball in the opponent's side of the court scores a point. The game is played on a rectangular court divided by a net, and each team tries to prevent the opposing team from scoring by blocking or returning the ball.</dd>
<dt>Handball</dt>
<dd>Handball is a fast-paced team sport where two teams of seven players (including the goalkeeper) each try to score goals by throwing a small ball into the opponent's net. The game is typically played indoors on a rectangular court, and the team that scores the most goals by the end of the match wins.</dd>
